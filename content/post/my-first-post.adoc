= Blogstarter

Social media is dumb. They all want your attention and none show only the stuff you want.
And as a content creator, none of them is the ideal platform for all the stuff I make.
So I decided to make my own!
I imagine this blog to be a ragbag for all the stuff I make, be it coding articles, art or gaming related stuff,
all sorted with categories.

And for this first post, I want to explain how I did it.
That way other people can copy my workflow and tell me how to improve it!

I wanted a static website because... no database, no database problems!
Easy editing and nice presentation are still important so I turned to my friend https://asciidoctor.org/[Asciidoc].
I stumbled over https://opensource.com/article/17/8/asciidoc-web-development[this article] by Sarah Thornton in which she
explains how she writes her blog with AsciiDoc and a framework called https://gohugo.io/[Hugo].
Hugo can translate MarkDown and AsciiDoc to HTML and CSS which is exactly what I wanted.
It also supports a contact form through Formspring and comment section through Disqus!

The next thing to think about was deployment. Where to host and with how?
First I tried a Docker container with AWS but this got too complicated for a static website.
I looked around some more and found https://www.netlify.com/[netlify] which makes deployment of web projects easy and
for a website like mine it's even free. The only thing I have to pay for is my domain https://minmo.tech/.

== How does it work?

https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/hosting-on-netlify/[There's actually documentation on this by the Hugo team!]

You have to create a netlify.toml file on the top level on your Hugo project which specifies the Hugo version, the build
command, and the build location. You commit all this to your git remote (GitHub or similar) and connect it to netlify.
Now you have to confirm build commands, connect your domain (you might have to change the DNS provider) and voil√°!
Your website is online!

== What's next on here?

My first article is already finished and ready to go soon (after some proof-reading from friends and family).
It's gonna be about easy continuous deployment on home projects.
I also have made some art stuff I'm gonna publish here soon, so look forward to it!
